PI & Product increment & A version of the product that includes all completed features and fixes from the current sprint. It represents a concrete step toward the final product. \\ \hline
DOC & Technical documentation & Written materials that describe the functionality, architecture, and use of a system. It serves as a reference for developers, end-users, administrators, and other stakeholders to understand how to build, operate, maintain, or use the system. \\ \hline
